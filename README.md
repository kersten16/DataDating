Universite Paris Saclay Interactive Information Visalization

Visuals on https://kersten16.github.io/InfoVis/docs

There are three visualizations shown on the page. The first is a radial lollipop chart. Currently, this would be the main overview. Below, is an example icon cloud that would be attached at the end of each lollipop on the first chart. Lastly, is a scatterplot with history over time that would be accessed by selecting a country on the first chart.

#### Radial lollipop:
This chart shows the average number of times a user opened their app ont he given day per country (encoded in length), and will also show if there was a preventative COVID measure announced that day for each country as well as have the icon clouds integrated (described below). There is a time slider to scroll through different available dates. This allows a comparison in user activity for each country and whether the region was under isolating restrictions.

#### Icon cloud:
The cloud is made of icons, hearts represent swipes (pass or like) and message icons represent messages sent by a given user. Each full size icon represents 10 counts and if there are any leftovers, an icon scaled by that amount (for example if there was 64 messages, there would be 6 full sized icons and one icon at 4/10th of the size). This allows viewers to gauge the proportion of activity allocated to swiping vs messages.

#### Scatterplot:
