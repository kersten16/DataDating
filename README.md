### What are the visualizations and how to read them

There are three visualizations shown on the page. The first is a radial lollipop chart. Currently, this would be the main overview. Below, is an example icon cloud that would be attached at the end of each lollipop on the first chart. Lastly, is a scatterplot with history over time that would be accessed by selecting a country on the first chart.

#### Radial lollipop:
This chart shows the average number of times a user opened their app ont he given day per country (encoded in length), and will also show if there was a preventative COVID measure announced that day for each country as well as have the icon clouds integrated (described below). There is a time slider to scroll through different available dates. This allows a comparison in user activity for each country and whether the region was under isolating restrictions.

#### Icon cloud:
The cloud is made of icons, hearts represent swipes (pass or like) and message icons represent messages sent by a given user. Each full size icon represents 10 counts and if there are any leftovers, an icon scaled by that amount (for example if there was 64 messages, there would be 6 full sized icons and one icon at 4/10th of the size). This allows viewers to gauge the proportion of activity allocated to swiping vs messages.

#### Scatterplot:

### Who are these visualizations for and why should they care
Our original target audience was researchers interested in how COVID-19 affected online dating behaviour specifically, if users took actions that indicated more meaningful connections (such as an increase in messaging) or if they relied on online socialization more than before (number of times they open the app). This could help target mental health campaigns and guide policy making in the future. As we created our design we realized that this information may be more useful to dating platforms. Knowing how user behaviour changes with environmental events can guide the timing of updates, marketing, when there may be pressure on memory and bandwidth, etc. Further analysis on whether any correlation is present of significant would need to occur before any meaningful conclusions can be drawn. Because this visualization focuses more on presenting an idea (that COVID policies may have affected online dating practices) rather than proves a hypothesis, it primarily serves as inspiration for further more detailed research on the topic. As such, the principle audience would have to be researchers.
